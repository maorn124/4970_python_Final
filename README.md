This is my last project for the semester and I did Option 1 the PyQt5 interface. Using my code and after the requirements.txt file installed. 
Run the program main.py. A window will appear in the middle of your screen where you can you have the options to load/save previosly created content.
Then you have the options to delete, add, and edit a league. In the text box under "Edit league" type in the league you want to add and click "Add League".
After creating the league click on it and click on "Edit League", you can change the name if you want, if not click "OK". This now will take you to the team editor.
In the team editor you have the option to add, edit, and delete a team created. Click on "Add team" to enter the team name. 
After creating the team click on it and click on "Edit Team", you can change the name if you want, if not click "OK". This now will take you to the team member editor.
Now here inside the team you will be able to add, update, and delete a member from the team. When you click on "Add Member" it will prompt you to enter a name and then an email.
Close all the windows when you are done and you can save the file as a .txt and load up again when you choose to do so.
